His entitlement is further highlighted by his confusion and distress when the family suddenly departs Privet Drive, leaving behind his usual comforts.  \n\nMagical encounters leave Dudley terrified of Harry—after Hagrid temporarily gives him a pig’s tail, he becomes fearful, screaming and avoiding Harry whenever possible.
